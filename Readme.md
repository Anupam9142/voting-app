## Team Number 38 - Vote Gauge

### Project Overview

In this present pandemic period, the digital approach has been the most effective then one has ever thought off. There is always a need to assess every individual’s choice and opinion. According to the traditional method, the only way that was carried out was voting and discussion sessions, while the discussion has skilled up to virtual meeting and there still seems space for considering public voting system. Now online voting system could be the only key to handle such situations in this adverse condition, if and only if the security and the anonymity of the voters are secured. This system of voting could bring a revolution in any adverse situation.

In the project “VOTE GAUGE”, we tried to device a user friendly yet secured process to carry out students voting process. As per the problem mentioned, we have access to the email id’s of the voters, we can easily map out the valid voters and also make sure of the presence of the fake voters. This project could be used in large scale with minor upgradations.

### Solution Description

A website made by us in this project has several routes but only the admins are given the admin route in which we added the minute details of the voting, the nominies and the list of the voters (.json file with every details).
* The voters can login and vote when the voting is live.
* The server processes the request as soon as the voter chooses the party and submits it finally.
* The server checks if the voter is in the voting list provided by the admin.
* It further checks if the user has already voted, if yes the voter will be not be allowed to vote and a message will be displayed.
* The number of votes would be added to the Nominee as voted by the voters.
* A message is displayed when the voting is over.
